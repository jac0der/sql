I would characterize their audio aura by writing a query to find the average (AVG) of the energy, valence, and danceability of all their songs
then limit the results to show only 100 records in ascending order.

This may not be the best approach of caculating the user's audio aura as its getting a general average of the top 100 songs.
A better approcah I would use is to first reduce the result set to about the top 20 songs, and getting the songs sorted first
with the highest energy, then danceability then valence, in descending order.

This will allow me to get a better idea of the user's music preference.
